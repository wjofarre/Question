# Question
DAT7 

Project Question:

How effective are punishment and prevention programs in reducing/deterring specific types of crime? Example: does increasing the restrictions on gun ownership laws reduce gun violence in the particular area by a significant margin? This question would probably have to be focused on a specific area and a handful of specific programs.  In order to answer the question one would have to look not only at the number of arrests but also the total number of incidents as the end goal would be to deter crime rather than increase arrests. To answer this question it makes sense to focus on an urban area with a dense population and enough data to examine. For this reason I chose to focus on LA because they document their crime data efficiently and itâ€™s been consistent for the last couple years. 

Data set:

https://performance.lacity.org/en/stat/goals/8ya7-fqzd/6hq5-v2wg/4zjw-te48

This is the entire data set but I will extract from it the necessary stats that will be needed. In addition I will need to do some research on certain deterrence programs LA has implemented but it is unlikely that those sources will have meaningful data to add to the data set above and will be used mainly as a reference throughout the project.
